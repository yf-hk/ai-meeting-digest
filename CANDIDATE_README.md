# AI Meeting Digest - Candidate Submission

## 1. Technology Choices

* **Frontend:** React 19 with TanStack Router, TanStack Query, and Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Hono.js with TypeScript and oRPC for type-safe API communication
* **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
* **AI Service:** OpenRouter with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (primary) and Meta Llama 3.2 (fallback)

### Why This Stack?

I chose this modern, type-safe stack for several reasons:

- **React 19 + TanStack Router**: Provides excellent developer experience with file-based routing and built-in data fetching
- **Hono.js**: Lightweight, fast web framework with excellent TypeScript support and edge runtime compatibility
- **oRPC**: Enables end-to-end type safety between frontend and backend, reducing runtime errors
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL**: Robust database solution with excellent TypeScript integration and migration support
- **OpenRouter**: Provides access to multiple AI models (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Llama 3.2) with automatic fallback, rate limiting protection, and unified API interface for reliability
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development with consistent design system

I prefer cutting-edge software and frameworks that offer superior performance, cost-effectiveness, and robustness. 

### Development Tools & Workflow

- **Bun**: Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager for improved development speed
- **Moonrepo**: Monorepo management tool for coordinating workspace builds and dependencies
- **Biome**: Ultra-fast linter and formatter for consistent code quality across the entire codebase
- **Ultracite**: All in one Biome configuration defaults
- **Husky + lint-staged**: Git hooks for automated code quality checks on commit
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing framework for comprehensive user journey testing
- **Vitest**: Fast unit testing framework with excellent TypeScript support

## 2. How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun runtime
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenRouter API key

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd ai-meeting-digest
   bun install
   ```

2. **Database setup:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/backend
   # Start PostgreSQL with Docker
   bun run db:start

   # Generate Prisma client and push schema
   bun run db:generate
   bun run db:push
   ```

3. **Environment configuration:**
   Create `.env` files in both `apps/backend` and `apps/frontend`:

   **Backend (.env):**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/ai_meeting_digest"
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key"
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your_auth_secret"
   BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   ```

4. **Start development servers:**
   ```bash
   # From project root - starts both frontend and backend
   bun run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
bun run test:unit

# Run E2E tests
bun run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI
bun run test:e2e:ui
```

## 3. Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### Architecture Decisions

**Monorepo Structure**: Used a workspace-based monorepo to share types and utilities between frontend and backend while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

**Type-Safe API Communication**: Implemented oRPC for end-to-end type safety, eliminating the need for separate API documentation and reducing integration bugs.

**Database Design**: Created a comprehensive schema supporting workspaces, collaboration features, and detailed meeting analytics - going beyond basic requirements to demonstrate enterprise-level thinking.

### Challenge Features Implementation

**1. Shareable Digest Links ✅**
- Implemented unique `publicId` field in summaries table
- Created public route `/digest/:publicId` with no authentication required
- Added share functionality with clipboard integration
- Includes proper error handling for invalid/expired links

**2. Real-time Streaming Response ✅**
- Built custom SSE (Server-Sent Events) streaming system
- Implemented `StreamingProcessor` component for real-time UI updates
- Created streaming endpoints that process and stream AI responses word-by-word
- Includes proper error handling and connection management

### Additional Features Implemented

**Advanced Meeting Management:**
- File upload support for transcripts (text files, audio files)
- Meeting status tracking (CREATED, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
- Workspace organization for team collaboration
- Meeting analytics and insights dashboard

**AI Processing Enhancements:**
- Dual model support with automatic fallback (Gemini → Llama)
- Structured data extraction (summaries, action items, topics, sentiment analysis)
- Speaker identification and confidence scoring
- Processing time tracking and optimization

**Collaboration Features:**
- Multi-user workspaces with role-based access
- Commenting system with threaded discussions
- Action item assignment and tracking
- Tag-based organization and filtering

**User Experience:**
- Responsive design with dark/light theme support
- Progressive loading states and skeleton screens
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Export functionality (PDF, JSON, text formats)

### Trade-offs Made

**Performance vs Features**: Chose to implement comprehensive features which increased complexity but provides a more realistic enterprise solution.

**AI Model Selection**: Used OpenRouter instead of direct Gemini API for better reliability and model fallback capabilities, though this adds a small latency overhead.

**Database Complexity**: Implemented a full relational schema rather than simple key-value storage to support advanced features like workspaces and analytics.

**Authentication**: Used Better Auth for production-ready authentication instead of simple JWT, adding setup complexity but providing better security.

### What I Would Do Differently With More Time

1. **Real-time Collaboration**: Implement SSE-based real-time editing of summaries and action items
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Add more sophisticated meeting insights and productivity metrics
3. **Mobile App**: Create React Native companion app for mobile access
4. **Integration APIs**: Build webhooks and integrations with Slack, Teams, and calendar systems
5. **Advanced AI Features**: Implement meeting sentiment analysis, speaker emotion detection, and automated follow-up suggestions

## 4. AI Usage Log

I extensively used AI programming assistants throughout this project, primarily Claude and GitHub Copilot:

**Architecture & Planning (20% of development time):**
- Used Claude to design the database schema and API structure
- Generated comprehensive Prisma models with proper relationships
- Planned the component architecture and state management approach

**Code Generation (40% of development time):**
- GitHub Copilot for boilerplate code generation (React components, API routes)
- Claude for complex business logic implementation (AI processing, streaming)
- Generated TypeScript types and validation schemas
- Created comprehensive test suites with realistic test data

**Problem Solving (25% of development time):**
- Used Claude to debug complex streaming implementation issues
- Resolved TypeScript type conflicts in the oRPC setup
- Optimized database queries and implemented proper error handling
- Solved authentication integration challenges with Better Auth

**Documentation & Polish (15% of development time):**
- Generated comprehensive code comments and documentation
- Created this README with detailed setup instructions
- Implemented proper error messages and user feedback
- Added loading states and responsive design improvements
- Configured development toolchain (Biome, Moonrepo, Ultracite) for optimal developer experience

**Specific AI Contributions:**
- **Streaming Implementation**: Claude helped design the SSE streaming architecture and error handling
- **Database Design**: AI assisted in creating the comprehensive Prisma schema with proper relationships
- **Type Safety**: Copilot generated most of the TypeScript interfaces and validation schemas
- **Testing**: AI generated comprehensive E2E test scenarios and mock data
- **UI Components**: Copilot accelerated creation of consistent, accessible React components

**AI Effectiveness**: Using AI tools increased my development velocity by approximately 3x while maintaining high code quality. The combination of Claude for complex problem-solving and Copilot for routine code generation proved highly effective.
